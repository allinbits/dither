Privacy Policy
==============

Last revised on 2020-02-11

### The Gist

All in Bits Inc will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.

We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with it.

We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.

That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.

### Reuse

This document is based upon the [Automattic Privacy Policy](http://automattic.com/privacy/) and is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/). Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse All in Bits Inc or its use of the work.

All in Bits Inc, Inc. ("All in Bits Inc") makes available services include our web site (dither.chat), our blog, our API, and any other software, sites, and services offered by All in Bits Inc in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). It is All in Bits Inc's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Questions

### Visitors

Like most website operators, All in Bits Inc collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. All in Bits Inc's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how All in Bits Inc's visitors use its website. From time to time, All in Bits Inc may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

All in Bits Inc also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. All in Bits Inc does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to All in Bits Inc's websites choose to interact with All in Bits Inc in ways that require All in Bits Inc to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that All in Bits Inc gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. All in Bits Inc collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with All in Bits Inc. All in Bits Inc does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

### Aggregated Statistics

All in Bits Inc may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, All in Bits Inc may monitor the most popular parts of dither.chat. All in Bits Inc may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, All in Bits Inc does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

All in Bits Inc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on All in Bits Inc's behalf or to provide services available at All in Bits Inc's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. All in Bits Inc will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, All in Bits Inc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when All in Bits Inc believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of All in Bits Inc, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, All in Bits Inc may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with All in Bits Inc and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. All in Bits Inc takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. All in Bits Inc uses cookies to help All in Bits Inc identify and track visitors, their usage of All in Bits Inc Service, and their Service access preferences. All in Bits Inc visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using All in Bits Inc's websites, with the drawback that certain features of All in Bits Inc's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Data Storage
All in Bits Inc uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.
