# Dither Documentation

Welcome to Dither! Dither is a new open source project that aims to create an uncensorable and decentralized social network that is built on the Cosmos Hub. Once IBC is launched on the Hub, we will look into launching our own Dither blockchain.

Documentation is in the works. The [Software Design Document](./software-design.md) is a good place to learn what we're planning on building.
