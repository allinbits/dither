# Dither Proof-of-Concept

> This is milestone #1 of the [Dither Roadmap](./roadmap.md).

We will work on building a proof-of-concept version of Dither and deploy it publicly to the Cosmos community. The POC feature set is unstable and continues to change as we move quickly through iterations and feedback rounds. This  POC will inform us on the feasibility of a full-featured Dither, possible future scaling concerns, and also collect invaluable feedback from the community.

The Proof-of-Concept is available to test at [dither.chat](https://dither.chat). Thanks for your feedback!
