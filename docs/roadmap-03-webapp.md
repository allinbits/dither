# Dither Web Client (beta)

> This is milestone #3 of the [Dither Roadmap](./roadmap.md).

The Dither Web Client serves as a way for end-users to view messages, post messages, and interact with other users on the Dither social network. We plan on building mobile applications as well, but it makes the most sense to start with a web client.

## Requirements

- **Security considerations** - 

## Reach Goals

- **Support for browser extensions** - There are upcoming browser extensions for Cosmos blockchains that function similarily to MetaMask. These are Lunie and Keplr. We should look into how difficult it would be to support these browser-based wallets.
