# Dither Documentation

> This is milestone #5 of the [Dither Roadmap](./roadmap.md).

We need to provide comprehensive documentation for developers on how they can (1) implement the Dither Protocol within their app, (2) run their own Dither Indexer to provide messaging for their own blockchain, and (3) connect to the Dither API to receive messages and events.
