# Dither Roadmap

This is the current software development roadmap for Dither. We plan to start official development in Q2 2020, and the estimated end date is Q2 2022.

## First six months

[**Dither Proof-of-Concept**](./roadmap-01-poc.md) - We will work on building a proof-of-concept version of Dither and deploy it publicly to the Cosmos community. The POC feature set is unstable and continues to change as we move quickly through iterations and feedback rounds. This  POC will inform us on the feasibility of a full-featured Dither, possible future scaling concerns, and also collect invaluable feedback from the community. (S)

[**Dither Protocol Specification (alpha)**](./roadmap-02-spec.md) - We will research, design, and publish a messaging protocol for Dither, built on top of the Cosmos Hub memo field, with future support for IBC  in mind. (S)

[**Dither Indexer (alpha)**](./roadmap-03-indexer.md) - The indexer will collect all Cosmos Hub memos that support the Dither protocol and allow for viewing, searching, and indexing, as well as user account features. We will publish an open source Dither Indexer on GitHub. (M)

[**Dither Web Client (alpha)**](./roadmap-04-webapp.md) - The first interface for Dither will be for a desktop and mobile web client. It will be built on a modern front-end web stack and published on GitHub. (M)

## Second six months

[**Dither Protocol Specification (beta)**](./roadmap-05-spec.md) - We will continue working on and improving on the protocol specification and culminate in a beta release with a feature freeze. The feature freeze will be required for the beta  releases of the indexer and the web client. (S)

[**Dither Indexer (beta)**](./roadmap-06-indexer.md) - Based on the frozen feature set of the beta Dither Protocol Specification, we will continue testing, updating, and improving the performance of the Indexer, culminating in a beta release of the Dither Indexer on GitHub. (M)

[**Dither Web Client (beta)**](./roadmap-07-webapp.md) - We will continue to fix bugs, improve performance & accessibility, and release feature updates to the web client, culminating in a beta release of the Dither Web Client on GitHub. (L)

[**Dither Website (alpha)**](./roadmap-08-website.md) - We will start working on designing and building a marketing site for Dither, aimed at two audiences: application developers and end users. The website will contain our proposed feature roadmap.  (S)

## Third six months 

[**Dither Blockchain Research**](./roadmap-09-blockchain.md) - Depending on the throughput of the Cosmos Hub and the traction of Dither, we may be forced to move onto a separate blockchain. We will research the work required to convert Dither into a custom blockchain application (likely built on the Cosmos SDK). (M) 

[**Dither iOS Client (alpha)**](./roadmap-10-ios.md) - We will start designing and building an iOS app for Dither with initial support for phones, and later support for tablets. (L)

[**Dither Android Client (alpha)**](./roadmap-11-android.md) - We will start designing and building an Android app for Dither with initial support for phones, and later support for tablets. (L)

[**Dither Documentation (alpha)**](./roadmap-12-docs.md) - We will write documentation for the Dither protocol and provide tutorials for application developers to implement Dither support in their own application. (S)

## Fourth six months

[**Dither Blockchain (testnet)**](./roadmap-13-blockchain.md) - If Dither is overloading the Cosmos Hub with transactions, we will look into turning Dither into a custom Cosmos SDK-based application. This deliverable is a promise that we will launch at least one testnet for the proposed Dither Blockchain. (M) 

[**Dither iOS Client (beta)**](./roadmap-14-ios.md) - The second client to be built for Dither is an iOS mobile application with support for phones. (L)

[**Dither Android Client (beta)**](./roadmap-15-android.md) - The third client to be built for Dither is an Android  mobile application with support for phones. (L)

[**Dither Website (beta)**](./roadmap-16-website.md) - We will continue maintaining the Dither website and updating content based on user feedback & research, roadmap updates, etc.(S)

[**Dither Documentation (beta)**](./roadmap-17-docs.md) - We will continue maintaining Dither documentation and updating content based on developer feedback, feature improvements, new tutorials, etc. (S)
