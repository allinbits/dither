# Dither Roadmap

This is the current software development roadmap for Dither. We plan to start official development in Q2 2020, and the estimated end date is Q2 2022.

## FIRST SIX MONTHS

[**Dither Protocol Specification (beta)**](./roadmap-01-spec.md) - We will research, design, and publish a messaging protocol for Dither, built on top of the Cosmos Hub memo field, with future support for IBC  in mind.

[**Dither Indexer (beta)**](./roadmap-02-indexer.md) - The indexer will collect all Cosmos Hub memos that support the Dither protocol and allow for viewing, searching, and indexing, as well as user account features. We will publish an open source Dither Indexer on GitHub.

[**Dither Web Client (beta)**](./roadmap-03-webapp.md) - The first interface for Dither will be for a desktop and mobile web client. It will be built on a modern front-end web stack and published on GitHub.

## FIRST YEAR

[**Dither API**](./roadmap-04-api.md) - We will design, publish, and support public API endpoints that allow developers to retrieve data that is indexed by the Dither protocol and display it to end-user clients. 

[**Dither Documentation Website**](./roadmap-05-docs.md) - We will document the Dither protocol and write tutorials for application developers to implement Dither support in their own application.

[**Dither Website**](./roadmap-06-website.md) - We will create a marketing website for Dither, aimed at two audiences. The application developer audience and the end-user audience.

## AFTER TWO YEARS 

[**Dither iOS Client**](./roadmap-07-ios.md) - The second client to be built for Dither is an iOS mobile application with support for phones.

[**Dither Android Client**](./roadmap-08-android.md) - The third client to be built for Dither is an Android  mobile application with support for phones.

[**Dither Blockchain**](./roadmap-09-blockchain.md) - If Dither is overloading the Cosmos Hub with transactions, we will look into turning Dither into a custom Cosmos SDK-based application.
