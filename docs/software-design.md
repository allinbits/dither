# Dither Software Design Document

## I. Goals & Vision

Dither is a collection of open source components that works together to enable an uncensorable and decentralized social network for web and mobile devices. User interaction on Dither is powered by the Cosmos Hub blockchain. User data is stored in an SQL database that is written to by a transaction indexing tool that we create.

Dither is made up of these components:

* Dither Blockchain
* Dither Indexer
* Dither Web Client
* Dither iOS Client
* Dither Android Client

### 1. Business Goals

The long term vision of Dither is a self-sustaining community of engaged users and volunteer developers who together run an uncensorable and decentralized social network.

The vision of Virgo is to provide the world with the best open collaboration technology. Without Dither, the Virgo community would be bereft of a resilient means of communicating across the world without censorship.

Today's social networks are means for the majority of humanity to communicate with their local and global communities. But these networks are owned by corporations that serve their shareholders, and not their billions of users. It is the mission of Dither to solve the issue of centralized power and censorship created by current social networks. We hope to offer to users of Dither their own sovereign channel of communication to the world without fearing for censorship or bans.

### 2. Business Needs

#### i. User Personas

#### ii. Defining Success

There are multiple levels of success for Dither. Level 1 is usage - if have a healthy population who log into Dither on a daily basis, we can say we've suceeded on one level. Level 2 is developers - if we have a healthy ecosystem of developers who use Dither, we can say we've succeeded on higher level. Level 3 is sustainability - if Dither becomes a self-governed social network, we can say we've made it.

### Scope

## II. Requirements/System Overview

### 1. User Requirements
### 2. Functional Requirements

#### i. Dither Blockchain

Dither is a social network powered by blockchain technology. Currently, this is the Cosmos Hub blockchain. We expect that with future growth, we will strain the limits of the transaction throughput on the Cosmos Hub. Well, either that or the transactions will be too expensive to combat the greater usage. The long-term goal of Dither is to put it onto its own application-specific blockchain.
