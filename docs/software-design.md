# Dither Software Design Document

## Introduction

Dither is a collection of open source components that works together to enable an uncensorable and decentralized social network for web and mobile devices. User interaction on Dither is powered by the Cosmos Hub blockchain. User data is stored in an SQL database that is written to by a transaction indexing tool that we create.

### Scope

Dither is made up of these components:

* Dither Blockchain
* Dither Indexer
* Dither Web Client
* Dither iOS Client
* Dither Android Client

### Milestones

See the [roadmap](./roadmap.md)

## Components

## Dither Blockchain

Dither is a social network powered by blockchain technology. Currently, this is the Cosmos Hub blockchain. We expect that with future growth, we will strain the limits of the transaction throughput on the Cosmos Hub. Well, either that or the transactions will be too expensive to combat the greater usage. The long-term goal of Dither is to put it onto its own application-specific blockchain.
